**First Mini-Project**

A short Python script that organizes your 'Downloads' folder by file type.

- Detects common file types: PDFs, images, documents, audio, zips, code, and spreadsheets
- Automatically creates folders (if they donâ€™t exist)
- Moves each file into its matching folder
- Handles unknown file types by placing them into a `misc/` folder
- Works cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)


TO USE:

1. Clone or download this repo:
